## Risk Management & Security Frameworks

### Threat, Risk & Vulnerability

- **Threat** → Potential cause of harm.
- **Vulnerability** → Weakness that can be exploited.
- **Risk** → The potential impact when a threat exploits a vulnerability.

Understanding this relationship is fundamental to defensive cybersecurity.

---

### Security Frameworks Studied

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**
- **NIST Special Publication 800-53**
- **ISO/IEC 27001**

These frameworks provide structured guidance for implementing security controls and managing risk within organizations.

Security controls discussed:
